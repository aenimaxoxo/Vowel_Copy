This program does the following: 

Takes a text file as input and processes it as follows: 

1.
	For words with length >1, if the first letter is uppercase, it becomes lowercase. 
	Similarly, if the first character is lowercase, it becomes uppercase.
	The same effect is performed on the last character of each word. 
	The changed words are written to a new txt file called new_output.txt

2. 
	All words that begin with a vowel (of any size) are written into a file called vowel_starters.txt. 
	The vowels have not been formatted in our vowel_starters.txt, but they have been in new_output.txt

Contained in this ZIP are the following: 
	- vowel_copy.c			// commented code
	- vcc				// out file
	- lipsum.txt			// sample lorem ipsum text
	- test4vowels.txt		// test to make sure vowels are working. Our vowel_starters.txt should == test4vowels.txt
